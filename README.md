NBA Salary Prediction 

Introduction

  The NBA is a league known all around the world. The fans are everywhere and it is up to the executives and the General Manager to sign players that will help the team win a championship. The fans depend on these executives to make the right decision, but there are always instances where a player is overpaid. The NBA Salary Prediction model will help General Managers and other executives make decisions for the team's best interest. 
  This general idea of this model can be applied in other sports and leagues. The executives can use the stats respective to their sport to build the algorithm that will predict the salary of players in that sport. The idea of this model can be used in other leagues such as the NHL, MLB, MLS and the NFL.

  To better understand the the business I researched other factors that impacted the salary of an NBA player. These factors included the number of players each team had, number of players with abnormally low salaries, number of players with abnormally high salary, teams with the most players with abnormally low salary and teams with the most players with abnormally high salary. Other important stats such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median and the interquartile range were also calculated to better understand the dataset and the factors that affect the salary. 

Approach

  To understand the background information regarding salary, I found the strength of the correlation between the variables. On top of that, I had to normalize the variables and place them on a scale of 0 to 1 to make them more relatable with each other. It was also important to find the weight each variable had in the model. The weight of each variable differed when it came to the type of model. I calculated the importance of each variable and built various combinations to find the model with the best fit.  
  This model uses statistics from the 2016-2017 season and the salaries from the 2017-2018 season to analyze trends and predict salaries in the fututre. There were two types of models tested: a decision tree model and the AdaBoost machine learning algorithm. The machine learning algorithm provided better results overall as the performance indicators such as RMSE and variance were much better for the machine learning model when compared to the decision tree model.
